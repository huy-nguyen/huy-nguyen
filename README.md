### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Huy Nguyen.
I'm a Software Engineer at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), a biomedical and genomic research center in Cambridge, MA, where I work closely with a team of scientists to create web applications for exploring large and complex genetic data sets.

I'm passionate about creating beautiful, engaging and high-performance web applications using the latest cloud and web technologies.
I'm a huge fan of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and, some day, I might just be able to master [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

I'm currently exploring three broad areas of interest in software development:

- How functional, statically-typed programming languages can help developers write much more robust and provably correct web applications.
- How GPU technologies (such as [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) and its successor [WebGPU](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb)) and native execution technologies (such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) can enable higher-performance data visualizations in the browser.
- How the [twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) can be applied in practice to create reliable and scalable web applications.

I write a technical blog at [huy.dev](https://www.huy.dev).
You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/huy_dev) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/huynguyen3/).
