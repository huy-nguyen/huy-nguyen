### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Huy Nguyen.
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/) (via [Medical Science & Computing](https://mscweb.com/), a federal contractor).
I previously worked in various software engineering roles at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), [Harvard's Center for International Development](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid), and [Periscopic](https://periscopic.com/).

I'm passionate about creating beautiful, engaging and high-performance web applications using the latest cloud and web technologies.
I'm a huge fan of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and, some day, I might just be able to master [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

I have extensive experience developing large-scale, front end-focused, highly interactive data exploration and visualization platforms.
I'm currently exploring the following areas of software development:

- How functional, statically-typed programming languages, such as [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) and [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/), can help developers write much more robust and provably correct web applications.
- How GPU technologies (such as [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) and its successor [WebGPU](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb)) and native execution technologies (such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) can enable higher-performance data visualizations in the browser.
- How new software development paradigms such as microservices, container orchestration, infrastructure-as-code and [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) can be applied in practice to enable the development of reliable and scalable cloud-native web applications at high feature velocity.

I write a technical blog at [huy.dev](https://www.huy.dev/).
